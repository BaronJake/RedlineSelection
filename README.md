Super simple little VBA script to redline selected text in MS Word

I always end up forgetting to redline changes, especially if I leave word in Simple Markup view
That's why I put together this script that can quickly redline selections in word
That way you don't have to deal with turning tracking on/off and cutting and pasting.

Saved me a few headaches!
